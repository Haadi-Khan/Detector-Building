# Detector Building

This is my code for the Science Olympiad Division C Detector Building event, I'm going to post my code on github for the project so I can store it here. This event got cancelled for the '20-'21 season, but I'm going to clean my garbage code for the '19-'20 season so I have something usable for the next time build/test events are allowed.

## Detector Main

This is the .ino file for the actual competition, just run it and you should be good to go

## Detector Data Collect

This is a slightly modified file which disables some features (namely the led light blinking and temp readouts) to make data collection easier.
