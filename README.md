# Detector Building

This is my code for the Science Olympiad Division C Detector Building event.

## Detector Main

This is the .ino file for the actual competition, just edit the ppm limits and you should be good to go

## Detector Data Collect

This is a slightly modified file which disables some features (namely the led light blinking and ppm readouts) to make data collection easier.
